I have successfully completed the CodTech Level One: Simple Calculator task using BlueJ. The program I developed is a basic calculator written in Java.

The application starts by asking the user to input two numbers. Once the numbers are entered, a menu is displayed, allowing the user to select one of four operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).

After selecting an operation, the program performs the calculation and displays the result. Error handling is included to prevent division by zero, ensuring the program terminates gracefully if such an operation is attempted.

Developing this program in BlueJ was a valuable learning experience, as it allowed me to practice object-oriented programming concepts and enhance my Java skills. This task strengthened my understanding of user input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in Java.
